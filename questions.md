Rita Lei - P&E HW 2 – Answers for questions

1.What is the difference between a for loop and a while loop?
For loop: a condenser of while loop, containing multiple elements in one line of code
While loop: elements are written in single lines separately

2.What are the four parts of a for loop? What do they do?
* Initialization bar: set up an initializing variable
* Boolean test: test for an exit condition
* Implementation operation: update the value of the initializing variable 
* Things that the coder wants to happen during this counting increment discounting looping operation: draw something

3.What does "nested" mean in the context of nested loops?
One loop can be located in another loop. 
For example, define a variable x and a variable y. The first for loop under x condition can contain another loop under y condition. Therefore, for every x, do every y.
